        <p className="mb-4">Most startups assume superior technology creates lasting advantage. It doesn’t. As AI becomes commoditized, technical differentiation is fleeting. The companies that will fail build AI on legacy workflows, only making internal processes faster while leaving customer experience unchanged. <strong>They digitize pain instead of removing it.</strong></p>
        <p className="mb-4">Consider a law firm that buys AI to draft contracts 3x faster, but clients still wait weeks for responses and get surprised by bills. The firm got faster at producing the same frustrating service.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">If you analyze the unicorns, you’ll see they took the opposite approach. Zappos reached $1B not through selling better shoes, but 365-day returns, surprise upgrades, and 10-hour support calls. The product wasn’t shoes—it was a trustworthy e-commerce experience driving 75% repeat customers. Stripe hit $95B by making integration seven lines of code instead of weeks. They said no to early enterprise deals to perfect developer experience through beautiful documentation. Perplexity reimagined how AI answers should feel, conversational with clear citations that feel like talking to a friend, not querying a database. While the well-funded competitors with superior models are failing by optimizing only for model precision.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The pattern is clear: winners obsess over onboarding, support, and billing (the end-to-end experience) while competitors chase perceived core feature velocity. The greats have a vision of how their service should <strong>feel</strong> if built from scratch today, then design every touchpoint to deliver that feeling consistently.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In the next wave of AI companies, winners won’t have “the best models”. They’ll make customers <strong>feel</strong> something new.</p>

    title: "Young Founders Think Startups Are Performance Art",
    date: "September 2, 2023",
    content: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-4">Since dropping out and moving to Silicon Valley, I've spent two years building alongside and advising dozens of founders. What I've witnessed is 90% doing elaborate performance art masquerading as business. The most promising people get trapped building founder personas instead of solving real problems. They perfect their pitch decks while their products sit broken.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Most startups today are performance art, not science. And the performers have forgotten they're on stage.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-lg">The Identity Trap</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Many young founders start their journeys asking "who do I need to be to found a company?" or “what do I need to say to get investors” instead of "what problem am I uniquely positioned to solve?" The first questions put you in character-building mode; the latter puts you in problem-solving mode.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">People act a certain way because they want to be seen as that kind of person. This makes them act that way more, which strengthens the belief. There's nothing inherent about it, it's pure performance. Startup culture validates this from day one, rewarding founder identity before you've solved a single real problem.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The real work isn't building identity, it's developing internal coherence with your actual curiosity. It's the difference between starting a startup because that's what smart people do versus solving a problem you genuinely care about. One drains you, the other energizes you.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-lg">When Performance Meets Reality</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">I've watched brilliant founders pitch flawlessly but can't get users to stick around. 'Visionaries' whose roadmaps change monthly based on trends. 'Product people' who've never shipped anything people actually use. They become method actors who've forgotten they're in a play.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The most painful cases refuse to pivot despite years without progress. They've built an identity around their original idea and defending that identity becomes more important than solving problems. When you build an identity around your hypothesis, you stop being a scientist and become a defender of predetermined conclusions.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You end up missing real opportunities while defending a fake self.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-lg">The System Rewards This</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">The startup ecosystem enables performance art because it's easier to scale than science. VCs evaluate founders on storytelling ability, not problem-solving. Demo days are literal theater. The metrics that matter are fundraising rounds, not whether anyone uses the product.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You can build a founder identity in months and raise money on a compelling story. But you can't fake product-market fit. There's no prize for working on the wrong thing really hard.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-lg">The Way Out</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Start asking "How do I develop internal coherence?" Pay attention to problems that bother you when no one's watching. Notice what you research at 2 AM, what you can't stop thinking about.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Test ideas against reality quickly. Build something small, show it to people, watch their genuine reactions. Stay curious about being wrong. The moment you start defending ideas instead of testing them, you've stopped doing science.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The real winners don't gamble on their identities, they gamble on finding truth faster than everyone else. They don't care about being seen as visionaries; they care about seeing clearly. When users don't stick around, that's not identity failure. It's information, the kind that separates main characters from extras.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Stop trying to be someone. Just do the work.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Most founders think they need perfect products or validated markets. But VCs make social decisions, not analytical ones. They’re asking: “Is this founder hot right now?”</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Temperature comes from speed and FOMO. When you go all in—hire the best people, move aggressively, make bold bets—you generate heat.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Other smart people want in.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Momentum becomes self-reinforcing.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">When you play it safe—preserve runway, test small, hire carefully—you stay cold. No matter how good your fundamentals, cold companies don’t get funded.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The founders who understand this deploy everything toward creating heat: exceptional team, rapid progress, compelling narrative.</p>

    title: "Love Is War: Sartre, Self-Worth, and the Power Struggle of Intimacy",
    date: "Nov 15, 2020",

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 font-serif">I. Introduction: The Battlefield of Love</h3>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Jean-Paul Sartre believed that human relationships are inherently conflictual. In his existentialist framework, love isn't a peaceful union but a battlefield of competing freedoms. He writes, "While I attempt to free myself from the hold of the Other, the Other is trying to free himself from mine; while I seek to enslave the Other, the Other seeks to enslave me... Conflict is the original meaning of being-for-others" (Sartre 364).
        </blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">Sartre sees love as a paradox: we desire to be the center of the beloved's world, but doing so means reducing their freedom. In turn, we become vulnerable to their gaze, their judgment, their withdrawal. This back-and-forth produces the insecurity that defines romantic relationships. Love, then, is not harmony—it is a constant negotiation of value and importance.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 font-serif">II. Attraction and the Imbalance of Value</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">I agree with Sartre that relationships begin and are often sustained through a fundamental imbalance of perceived value. When we desire someone, it is often because they withhold the validation we crave. Their lack of immediate affirmation highlights the gap between how we see ourselves and how they see us. This gap creates insecurity, and attraction.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Experience and self-esteem play a major role in this dynamic. A person with high self-worth is less likely to be swayed by surface-level flattery because they don't need external validation. What interests them instead is someone who isn't immediately trying to impress them, someone who treats them as an equal or even ignores their conventional appeal. This interaction creates an imbalance they are unaccustomed to, which draws them in.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Conversely, someone with low self-esteem, especially if they rarely receive attention, will respond positively to any validation. Their need for affirmation makes them more susceptible to romantic interest, even from those with little genuine value to offer. In both cases, attraction stems from a perceived asymmetry in social or emotional capital, and the desire to close that gap.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 font-serif">III. The Validator and the Validatee</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">This leads to what I call the "validator/validatee dynamic." The validator is the more secure partner, independent, self-assured, emotionally detached. The validatee is insecure, codependent, and anchored in the relationship for self-worth. Sartre would describe this as an enslavement of freedom, but I believe many validatees welcome this dependency. To them, it is a relief. In the validator's world, they are finally seen as important.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">This dynamic can persist because the validatee becomes addicted to the feeling of being valued. Even when validation is withdrawn, they cling to the person who once gave them a sense of worth they couldn’t generate themselves. These relationships often appear toxic from the outside but feel deeply meaningful to the validatee.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 font-serif">IV. Power and the Personal</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Sartre emphasizes "the look"—the way we feel objectified under someone else's gaze. I agree that our perception is shaped by others, but I argue that deeper relational dynamics are built not on objectification but humanization. We don't manipulate people as abstract others; we manipulate them by learning their stories, their insecurities, their hopes. The more we know, the more leverage we have.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">For example, if someone is deeply insecure about their skin, a well-timed compliment feels transcendent. If a person is ostracized for being promiscuous, reframing that trait as "liberated" or "fun-loving" can make them feel uniquely seen and understood. This kind of validation transforms us in the eyes of the other, and makes the giver of that validation feel powerful.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 font-serif">V. Why Love Fails (and Sometimes Doesn’t)</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Sartre believes love ultimately fails because it curbs freedom. I agree, but with nuance. Relationships between people with balanced self-worth often collapse due to constant power struggles. Without a clear validator and validatee, both partners vie for control, affirmation, and centrality in each other's lives. The result is friction and emotional volatility.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">By contrast, love can endure when one partner fully submits to the other’s emotional hierarchy. The relationship is stable because roles are fixed, but it is not necessarily healthy. The validatee may lose their autonomy, but in return, they gain identity and meaning. These relationships, while imbalanced, often last the longest.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 font-serif">VI. Conclusion: Sartre and the Selfishness of Love</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Sartre helps us see love not as a fairytale, but as a war of perception. We love not just to connect, but to be important. I take this further: we love to be central. We humanize others only to better influence them. We exploit their vulnerabilities not always with malice, but with a selfish need to be needed.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Love is less about union than it is about hierarchy, a structure of validation, power, and self-worth. Sartre didn’t account for how deeply this structure is shaped by our inner narratives and emotional wounds. But he was right that love is not freedom. Love, in its rawest form, is a beautiful form of control, one that rarely works unless someone gives up first.</p>
